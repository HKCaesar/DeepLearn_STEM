# DeepLearn_STEM
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for infering Complex Oxide Octahedral Tilts from ABF STEM data.  
The python scripts setup a CNN, perform training, evaluation, and save checkpoints and tensorbard summary data for visualization.  
Code requires a GPU-enabled installation of TensorFlow v1.1 and higher.
